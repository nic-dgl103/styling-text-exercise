# Styling Text Exercise
This exercise was designed to help you understand this week's content. It is not graded.
1. Clone this repository onto your local computer.
2. In VS Code:
    * Give the body element a background-color of #f9f5f1. 
    * Change the colour of the text in the body element to #207D7A.
    * Go to https://fonts.google.com/ and 
        * Find the font called Source Code Pro, select the Regular 400 weight.
        * Find the font called Stint Ultra Condensed and select it.
        * Copy the link code and paste it in the head of the index file.
        * Copy the Source Code Pro CSS rule and apply it to the body element.
        * Copy the Stint Ultra Condensed CCS rule and apply it to the h1 element.
    * Change the font sizing:
      * Change the root font size to 62.5%;
      * Reduce the body font size to the equivalent of 12 pixels using the rem unit.
      * Increase the h1 font size to the equivalent of 260 pixels using the rem unit.
    * Reduce the line-height of the h1 to 1.8;
    * In the HTML, add line breaks between each word in the h1 using `<br />`
    * An h1 is a block element with a default margin of negative space above and below it. Remove the default margin by adding the `margin; 0;` declaration to the h1 element style.
    * Make all the text in the section element align right;
    * Resize your browser window to see how the layout of the page shifts with different screen sizes. The image was given a static size of 600 pixels in the HTML. Use CSS to overwrite that dimension and change the image width to 60%, a relative unit. Resize your browser window again to see how this change has affected the layout. 
    * Why did we not nest the image in a `<figure>` element?
